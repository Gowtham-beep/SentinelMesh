SentinelMesh is a distributed uptime monitoring platform that performs multi-region health checks using independent worker nodes and quorum-based verification to eliminate false positives.

It continuously monitors websites and APIs, records regional degradations, confirms global incidents through consensus, and delivers reliable alerts via asynchronous pipelines.

Built with a micro-ish, event-driven architecture using Node.js, Redis queues, and PostgreSQL, SentinelMesh demonstrates real-world backend engineering principles including distributed execution, fault tolerance, idempotent alerting, and production-grade observability.
